Eclipse Che is an open-source, next-generation development platform, leveraging container technology which offers a more streamlined on-boarding process for new developers to ensure they have the tools they need. Using stacks, Eclipse Che creates a workspace which brings the necessary technology to the task at hand. More information about Che can be found here.

Eclipse Che4zâ€™s primary goal is to bring the modern developer experience to mainframe software development. Achieving this makes on-boarding new developers in the world of mainframe simpler and easier.
