## Eclipse Che4z
  
Eclipse Che is an open-source, next-generation development platform, leveraging container technology which offers a more streamlined on-boarding process for new developers to ensure they have the tools they need. Using stacks, Eclipse Che creates a workspace which brings the necessary technology to the task at hand. More information about Che can be found here.

Eclipse Che4zâ€™s primary goal is to bring the modern developer experience to mainframe software development. Achieving this makes on-boarding new developers in the world of mainframe simpler and easier. Che4z is extending Che capabilities to be used also for mainframe application developers working with mainframe applications.

Eclipse Che4z currently comprises the following components:

- z/OS Resource Explorer
